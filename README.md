# Implementation-of-silicon-wafer-defect-classification-web-application-using-deep-learning- 
This project presents a solution for the wafers
classification of defected silicon wafers, a critical task in
semiconductor manufacturing processes. The classification aims
to identify various patterns of defects which are pivotal for
quality control. The presented approach in this paper leverages
deep learning techniques, employing Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Autoencoders, to automatically learn
discriminative features from wafer map images. The trained
model is then serialized into a pickle file for efficient deployment
and integration. To democratize access to the solution, a userfriendly
web interface is developed using Flask, enabling
seamless interaction with the classification model. Users can
upload wafer map images through the web page, and in return,
receive real-time predictions of the defect class, facilitating quick
decision-making in manufacturing processes. The presented
method demonstrates promising results, achieving high accuracy
in classifying defected silicon wafers across diverse patterns.
This contributes significantly to enhancing the efficiency and
reliability of semiconductor manufacturing, ultimately leading to
improved product quality and reduced production costs.
